The files for the .flac test (```03_flac_files.cpp```) can be found here: https://github.com/ietf-wg-cellar/flac-test-files.

They are divided into three groups: **subset**, **uncommon**, and **faulty**, and should be seperated into folders of those same names accordingly.

These files were not included with the repo since I didn't want to store half a GB of unnessecary audio data here. Just know that you'll need those files if you want to run ```test_03```.
